 ## Mission descriptions

 kob_starter_build_a_fleet_desc:0 "Admittedly, Kobolds are not the best swimmers. You'd even be hard-pressed to find even one brave enough to go fishing more than half a mile away from the shore. However, if we are to ever match up to the Gnomes and their strange-looking ships and  even stranger-looking weapons, then we'll need a fleet. And that means building one, a big one, bigger than whatever the Gnomes can come up with. So big that when we set out, Malliath himself will gaze down and grin at our efforts! Well, perhaps not that big, but big enough so that we will be able to finish what we started. To finish taking back what is rightfully ours. So, let us gather the timber and the clansmen, for the dragon's fleet must set sail!"
 kob_starter_fall_of_nimscodd_desc:0 "We've done it! Nimscodd has fallen, and with it the Gnomes' will to fight. After a thousand years, the ancestral wars between us and the Gnomes are now finished at last. With their will broken the question is now...what shall we do with them? For several weeks now the yips and yaps of our agitated and excited kin has filled the air of [Root.Capital.GetName], with two camps forming in response to that very question. On one hand, a very vocal group has been advocating for us to simply wipe the Gnomes out entirely and be done with it, settling the former lands with our own, repopulating what would be their hollowed-out cities and making use of the resources directly - paving the way for a truly Kobold coast. On the other hand, a group of more moderate Kobolds have been arguing that we could use their ingenuity to help us make even better traps and devices to use against the humans, not to mention that it would save us the hassle of clearing out a lot of dead Gnome bodies.\n\nThe constant debating and bickering has gotten to the point that [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] has been forced to call one final, grand debate to settle the matter at the next clan-meet. Only Malliath knows how that will go…"
 kob_starter_gnomes_undecided_1_desc:0 "This mission's requirements and rewards are determined by the choices made through §YThe Fall of Nimscodd§! mission's event: §YThe End of the Gnomish Wars§!."
 kob_starter_gnomes_undecided_2_desc:0 "This mission's requirements and rewards are determined by the choices made through §YThe Fall of Nimscodd§! mission's event: §YThe End of the Gnomish Wars§!."
 kob_starter_gnomes_purge_1_desc:0 "Though we triumphed over the Gnomish Hierarchy, we have yet to achieve a complete victory. There are still pockets of Gnome resistance throughout what is rightfully our land, and as long as they exist, we cannot ever truly be at peace. There will be no mercy for the wicked: Nimscodd will be made into an example to all those who would still cling onto the notion that there is place for anyone but Kobolds here. So to all Gnomes, hear this: find the nearest ship, and sail overseas, or die in a feeble attempt to resist, for there is no mercy for the wicked."
 kob_starter_gnomes_purge_2_desc:0 "Who knew that Gnome bodies could burn so bright? Who knew how little ash it would take to smother the sun? Every day, more and more gnomes are shunted out of their homes, their trinkets and belongings taken and forced at spear-point to either run or die, as more and more kobolds emerge from the hills everyday to repopulate the countryside, resettling into land that was always rightfully theirs. All that was theirs will be ours, and when the fires fade, when the last Gnome has been driven out, not a single trace of Gnomish culture will be left. It will be as though the hierarchy had never existed; only a foolish dream for a fool's mind. We shall achieve total victory, in Malliath's name."
 kob_starter_gnomes_tolerance_1_desc:0 "We are not cruel, merciless or heartless monsters, but rather benevolent, generous, and kind-hearted, as all Kobolds are and should strive to be. The Gnomes have only resisted us in the Dragonwake, as any civilization would when met with our force. Can we really fault them for what is merely self-defense? Now that our dominance is asserted over the Dragon Coast, we can offer them mercy. We can offer them peace. Though the scars of our prior conflicts are still here, in time, we have faith that these will fade. They will have a place in our government, in our politics, in our lands, and in time we can share the fruits of the Dragon Coast together. First, however, we will have to find means of convincing the Gnomes of our good intentions, and that will require no small amount of effort from our part."
 kob_starter_gnomes_tolerance_2_desc:0 "It seemed like it was only yesterday that Kobold trappers and Gnome mercenaries fought one another, and yet, now, such a notion seems totally aberrant. Kobold gem-smiths work side by side with Gnomish Artificers, working together for a better Dragon coast. The Gnomes freely share their knowledge with us, and in turn we have given them a place in our dens, companionship. Migrations happen frequently between what were once the islands of the Nimscodd hierarchy and the Dragon Coast's mainland, with some Gnomes returning to their own ancestral homes, while some Kobolds travel to the island cities to make a new start there. Here, in the Dragon Coast, all of short stature can be comrades with each other, in a shared struggle against Tall-Kind, as they seek out peace and prosperity as one people."
 kob_starter_conquer_pass_desc:0 "Having taken Axtagaru back from the Gnomes, its tunnels and burrows are under our rightful hands and watchful eyes once more. But recovering our southernmost dens is not enough. Axtagaru stands between the very heart of Kobold-kind and our enemies: from the reavers to the Gawedi horse-masters, to the Lorentish wine-barons. For us to be safe, it must be made into a fortress, an impassable den, a great dam to stop all of the petty and pesky humans from flooding our lands and tearing us all to pieces. We will turn Axtagaru into one massive death trap - every wall, every passage, every stone hiding a Kobold-approved contraption. All the hills, bridges and roads those human soldiers plan to traverse or use in the name of 'de-monsterisation'? Filled with traps! Bear traps, poison bombs, bolts, darts, ambushes, spike-filled holes in the ground, you name it, Axtagaru will have it. Most of them will die before they even see a Kobold, while those who survived will find themselves succumbing to crossbow darts and cleverly-rigged explosives soon enough. They'll think twice about invading us again."
 kob_starter_push_to_the_hills_desc:0 "The Dragonhills must be taken for one simple reason: Eaglecrest. Their population is infamous for raiding our villages and settlements, kidnapping and skinning kobold adults and children alike with a callous, cold mercy befitting the Tall-Folk. Our revenge must be brought to bear on the Eaglecrestians, lest they go unpunished for their crimes. Such a task will not be easy, for the vile skin-cutters live under the protection of the Gawedi eagle, and other nearby Tall-Folk are surely assured to intervene, but no matter: nothing will stand in our way between us and Eaglecrest's fall."
 kob_starter_push_south_desc:0 "Our glorious crusade against the Tall-Folk continues, ever and onwards! We have crossed the Gnomish Pass and retaken the Dragonhills, and now we look south, to the rich, bountiful lands held by the Reverish raiders, towards the bountiful city of Portnamm and the Halfling city of Turnwell. We will march in as conquerors, true to our legacy of Dragon-kind, solidifying once and for all our control over the entirety of the Dragon Coast."
 kob_starter_rally_the_clans_desc:0 "It's time! Centuries of stagnation will at last come to an end, as our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] has decreed that the Dragon Coast shall belong to the [Root.GetAdjective] [Root.GovernmentName], and to [Root.GetAdjective] [Root.GovernmentName] alone! Already, hordes of [Root.GetAdjective] warriors, brave and bold, armed with the finest clubs, wooden shields and traps are preparing to march - a little clumsily - to battle kin and Tall-Folk alike. We will be victorious! Hail [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName]! Yip yip, hurray!"
 kob_conquer_red_scales_desc:0 "[ROOT.Getkob_expanded_red_scales_mission_desc]"
 kob_starter_unify_kobolds_desc:0 "For the first time since time immemorial, our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] has managed to do the impossible. The centuries of Kobolds raiding, pillaging one another are now over! Blue, Red, and Green - it matters no longer, for we are now truly one people, united under [Root.Monarch.GetName]. A great celebration will be held in [Root.Capital.GetName], inviting the former rival clansmen to celebrate with us, as we encourage them to put aside past grievances so that we may look towards the future together. Oh, great [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], may your reign be strong and wise, for you have accomplished what no other Kobold thought was possible: peace in our time."
 kob_starter_honour_forefathers_desc:0 "We Kobolds are a deeply spiritual people, and not enough has been done to pay homage to the worship of the Dragons of old. Powerful, incredible creatures of immense strength, wisdom, and magic - the forefathers to our kind. Not only that, but it was mighty Tayekan the Blue who guided us out of the crushing depths of the caverns, and into the lands we know today as the Dragon Coast. We ought to build shrines in his name, in Malliath's, and these hallowed halls shall be filled with great amounts of coin so that our devotion may be known to all! Praise Malliath! Praise Tayekan! Praise all the dragons whose wings we wish to emulate, whose flight we wish to fly, whose wisdom and clemency we can only dare to beget!"
 kob_starter_kobold_coast_desc:0 "[ROOT.Getkob_expanded_kobold_coast_mission_desc]"
 kob_conquer_blue_scales_desc:0 "[ROOT.Getkob_expanded_blue_scales_mission_desc]"
 kob_starter_control_north_pass_desc:0 "Filthy swamps, marshes, and bogs populated by Human villages. It's a shock that there's any civilization in this wretched area - where there are so few hills and caverns for one to find shelter. Still, Westmoors contains several key fortifications that would be crucial for the purpose of defending [Root.GetName] against any invading Tall-Folk which would attempt to flank our defenses from the north. We shall claim these ruined towers and misused fortresses for ourselves, turning them into mighty and impenetrable labyrinths, carving the highlands' underground into a trap-filled maze."
 kob_starter_challenge_alenic_lords_desc:0 "Hear, hear! Gawed is a land of weaklings, cowards, traitors, and Kobildzan is the land of strong kobolds, hearty heroes, and loyal warriors! Our army, over fourty-thousand strong and counting, will overwhelm the Gawedi scum and ransack Gaweton and the rest of their pathetic, Tall-Folk lands! In the end, we will win, as was always decided by fate! Let Gawed hear this and cower! Oh, let Gawed hear the song of our war cry, the bellow of our Kobolds, as we charge, charge forward!"
 kob_starter_skewer_eagle_desc:0 "We have achieved what no Kobold a hundred years ago could ever have thought to do. Gawed - the once dominant power in northern Cannor - is under our total control, making us the uncontested masters of the Alenic plateau. Now it is the humans who must cower under us, for we are the masters of their fate, not the other way around! Eaglecrest has fallen, Gaweton has fallen, humanity trembles, and Kobolds yip and yap cheerfully to the sounds of complete victory as our armies parade throughout the Alenic countryside. Long live [Root.GetName]!"
 kob_conquer_green_scales_desc:0 "[ROOT.Getkob_expanded_green_scales_mission_desc]"
 kob_starter_push_along_coast_desc:0 "The city of Celmador is a strange one. Populated by Elves and Humans alike, it is an odd, bright, sky-reaching fortress at the heart of a colorful and yet frigid wood. Our soldiers tread around its walls with care, their usual chatter and dulled out to a faint muttering. There is Tall-Folk sorcery at play here, the sort we were not prepared for. This only serves to give us another reason to lay siege to the city, for controlling it will not only give us control of the northern Alenic border, but it will do away with an Elven holdout that we cannot tolerate, a threat we cannot abide by."
 kob_starter_dominate_north_gulf_desc:0 "The lands once settled by the Greenscale have been rather...disappointing. Sat atop a jagged coastline, trapped between the Humans of Westmoor and the Elves of Celmaldor, with nothing but fish, sheep and the odd clay pit to make a living off of. Our recent conquest of the northernmost edges of the Alenic plateau places up in a unique position to remedy this however: by building new settlements, we can encourage Kobolds to emigrate, an re-populate the Serpentshead, something which will serve as a springboard for further northern conquests."

 ## Custom Localisation

 kob_expanded_reorganise_tribes_desc:0 "There are many smaller clans within our country that are clamoring for our support - when they are not fighting amongst themselves that is. Our newest conquests have all but made the clans under our rule even rowdier, with den melees and moss sorting disputes growing all too common. A proper reorganization of the tribes is sorely needed, with our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] summoning a clan-meet to tackle the issue."
 kob_expanded_reorganise_tribes_title:0 "Reorganise the Tribes"
 kob_expanded_red_scales_mission_desc_not_red_scale:0 "The Redscales are a proud bunch. They believe they are the richest, strongest and most powerful Kobold clan of them all. Well, they are fools! They may control the fertile part of the Dragon Coast, but that merely means they have more land for the taking. We will see how their arrogance holds up when our warriors march into Fetaginbaia, as we take one major step towards re-unifying all of our brethren under the rule of [Root.Monarch.GetName]."
 kob_expanded_red_scales_mission_title_not_red_scale:0 "Subjugate the Red Scales"
 kob_expanded_green_scales_mission_desc_not_green_scale:0 "The Greenscales have always been seen as an outlier in kobold society. Aggressively isolationist and prone to raiding and plundering anything coming near their shores, it was no surprise that our efforts to subjugate them were both bloody and protracted. We can only thank Malliath that we were the ones to liberate our cousins instead, sparing them the fate of Gawedi conquest - which would certainly have resulted in the Tall-Folk skinning  their scales from their bodies. With the Greenscales' timely submission however this will not come to pass, and the Greenscales' very own Buruzagi has arrived in [Root.Capital.GetName] to offer our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] their allegiance."
 kob_expanded_green_scales_mission_title_not_green_scale:0 "Subjugate the Green Scales"
 kob_expanded_blue_scales_mission_desc_not_blue_scale:0 "Our warriors have braved the caves of the Dragonheights and the Dragondepths, laid siege to the gates of Mallayd, and taken the hills of the Dragonspine. Now the Buruzagi of the Bluescales, defeated and laid low, has come before us, offering his submission to the will of [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], for they know that else they may face death and dishonor. The war was bloody, having cost us hundreds if not thousands of kobolds, but such is the price of victory. From now on, it is the [Root.GetAdjective] [Root.GovernmentName] that will serve as the custodians to the fabled Kobold hoard."
 kob_expanded_blue_scales_mission_title_not_blue_scale:0 "Subjugate the Blue Scales"
 kob_has_tribes:0 "[Root.GetMonstrous TribesName]"
 kob_has_nobility:0 "[Root.GetNobilityName]"
 kob_expanded_kobold_coast_tolerance:0 "The day has finally arrived. All of the Dragon Coast finds itself under our control, and all who are a part of it will be much the better for it. Kobolds, Gnomes, and Halflings cheerfully toast and sing long into the night as we build a brighter, wiser, shared vision for the future together. Not since the time of the Gnomish Hierarchy has the coast experienced such prosperity, though this time it is not just one people that will flourish under Tayekan’s comforting shadow, but all those who are willing to share the dream."
 kob_expanded_kobold_coast_no_tolerance:0 "While our ambitions demand that we drive out the Tall-Folk not just from the Dragon Coast alone, it will have to do for now. Humans, Gnomes, Halflings, Elves: all are threats, not just to our dominion over the coastline but our very existence itself! The Tall-Folk would see us not merely fall, but reduced to a few dens in the bowels of the Dragondepths - if they do not kill us first that is. We must push ever onwards and forwards, building a future for Kobolds where neither the Tall-Folk or any other unworthy contender can challenge our claim over what is rightfully our land."

 kobildzan_halfling_tolerance_1_desc:0 "Turnwell is in our possession. Albeit not the biggest of the halfling cities, and in fact somewhat small compared to the metropolis of Viswall, it is nonetheless a major outpost of Redfoot halflings. So what is it that Kobolds are to do with its applefields, bakeries and bread market? The same thing we did with the gnomes, of course! Celebrate! Turnwell will be bright with lights and food and drink and partying for three whole days and three whole nights, a move that will surely convince the Halflings of our good intentions. After all, they are our equals in stature, ergo in the same boat as us when it comes to fighting oppression against the Tal-Folk - and once the party is over, perhaps we'll head into Small Country itself next, to kick the Humans to the curb and liberate the Small-Folk of Cannor from their Tall-Folk oppressors once and for all!"
 kobildzan_halfling_intolerance_1_desc:0 "Despite our shared stature, the Halflings are not brothers nor allies, but enemies! Enemies that must be rightfully purged and expelled from our lands if we are ever to keep Kobildzan safe. It matters not that they are subjects of Gawed and Lorent, forced to serve as pawns in their wicked games - they are soldiers of the Tall-Folk nonetheless, and would happily march alongside them to put down 'monsters' like ourselves. So we will show them, before they even get the chance to strike! Show them the might of Kobildzan! First, Turnwell will burn, and then Viswall, and finally Beepeck! All Halflings shall know our wrath, and they will know their place under our rule - or bun in dragonfire!"
 kobildzan_destroy_the_empire_desc:0 "For all its power and its might, the Empire of Anbennar has been little but a road-block to our ambition. Where were the Elector-Counts when Eaglecrest fell? Where was the Emperor when Gawed fell? They cowered in their homes. Behind their thrones, their walls, in the shadow of Anbenncost. They did nothing because they could do nothing: our ascent was inevitable, and the Tall-Folk knew this. We stand not merely as the masters of the Dragon Coast, but as the rising masters of Cannor itself! Kobildzan betiko! Kobildzan forever! For another thousand years and more!"
